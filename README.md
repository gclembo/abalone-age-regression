This project performs regression on the UCI ML dataset containing abalone data. I predicted the number of rings an abalone, which is used to estimate age, from various physical attributes. I used Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Numpy, and Seaborn for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. The dataset can be seen here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1/abalone.
